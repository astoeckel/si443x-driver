# Driver for the Silicon Labs Si443x wireless transceiver

The code in this repository implements a generic driver for the Silicon Labs
Si443x series of wireless transceivers. The code is tailored towards 8-bit
embedded systems such as AVR microcontrollers, however, as of now, only a
backend targeting Linux on a Raspberry Pi is implemented.

Note that the code in its current form is largely untested. The provided main
program switches the transceiver to on-off-keying (OOK) mode triggered by a GPIO
input pin on the Si443x module, making it a drop-in replacement for many cheap
443.92 MHz OOK transmitter modules.

## Usage with a Raspberry Pi

The `main.cpp` provided with this repository brings the transceiver on a
[RFM26W](https://www.pollin.de/p/funkmodul-hoperf-rfm26w-433-mhz-tx-rx-810311)
module to a transmit-only state with a frequency of 443.92 MHz. The carrier is
toggled on and off using the GPIO3 input on the RFM26W module. This frequency
and mode of operation (OOK) is used by a variety of wirelessly controlled
devices.

The below wiring diagram shows how the RFM26W module should be wired to a
Raspberry Pi if the `main.cpp` program is used.

In the above diagram, the RFM26W GPIO3 input is connected to GPIO pin 22 on the
Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is responsible for the generation of the
transmitted binary signal on GPIO pin 22.

## Compilation and installation of the main program

The main program uses the `wiringPi` library for the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins and
the CMake build system. Please install this library before continuing.

To download, compile, and install the provided example program run
```bash
# Download
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/si443x-driver

# Build
cd si443x-driver; mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make

# Installation
sudo install main /usr/bin/enable_transceiver
sudo install ../enable_transceiver.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl enable enable_transceiver
sudo systemctl start enable_transceiver
```
